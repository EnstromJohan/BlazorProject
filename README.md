# BlazorProjekt


In this school assignment, I have developed a film database using EF Code-First, 
adding various columns including a Film table with URL links and a SimilarFilms table to link related movies. 
I have also created an API with a data layer as a service to interact with the database and a server-side Blazor admin application to perform CRUD operations via the API. 
This admin application will use HttpClient to call the API and does not require JWT authentication or authorization.
